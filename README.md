# 📘 My Minimal Library Management System

Hi! I'm [Md Asraful], and this is a project I built entirely from scratch using **React**, **Redux Toolkit Query**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The goal was to create a minimal but complete **Library Management System** — focused on core features like viewing books, borrowing, and basic CRUD.

---

## 🚀 Why I Built This

While learning RTK Query and state management, I wanted a real-world use-case. So I thought:

> "Why not a small library system? Everyone loves books!"

This project helped me:

- Understand **client-side state/data caching**
- Work with **form handling** and **React Router**
- Apply **TypeScript** for safe API integration

---

## 🔧 Features I Implemented

- ✅ View All Books
- ✅ Add, Edit, and Delete Books
- ✅ Borrow a Book (with quantity and due date)
- ✅ View Borrow Summary
- ✅ Toast Notifications for UX feedback
- ✅ Fully Responsive UI with Tailwind
